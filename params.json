The difference in return between a portfolio and its\r\nbenchmark is the active return of the portfolio. Portfolio managers\r\nand their clients want to know what caused this active\r\nreturn. Performance attribution decomposes the active return. The two\r\nmost common approaches are the Brinson-Hood-Beebower model and a\r\nregression-based analysis.","google":"UA-40819362-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
