Many portfolio managers measure performance with reference to a
benchmark. The difference in return between a portfolio and its
benchmark is the active return of the portfolio. Portfolio managers
and their clients want to know what explains active
return. Performance attribution decomposes the active return. The two
most common approaches are the Brinson-Hood-Beebower model and a
regression-based analysis.
